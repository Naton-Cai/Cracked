# Cracked
Cracked is a video game prototype built in Godot, designed by Naton Cai and John Pham. Cracked is a Smash style PVP game developed on the theme of smashing vases similar to video games such as Legend of Zelda.

Each player controls a vase, who's goal is to grab their opponent and throw them against the walls and floors. When a vase breaks, they spew out a number of gems that can be picked up. 

## Controls
| Control | P1 | P2 |
| --- | --- |---|
| Jump/Resist | W Key | I Key |
| Fast Fall  | S Key| K Key |
| Left | A Key | J Key |
| Right  | D Key | L Key|
| Grab/Throw | E Key  | U Key |


## Notes from Naton Cai
This was my first time using Godot and over all only my second time seriously developing in a game engine, so a lot of this was a learning experience.
