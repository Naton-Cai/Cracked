# Cracked
Cracked is a video game prototype built in Godot, designed by Naton Cai and John Pham. Cracked is a Smash style PVP game developed on the theme of smashing vases similar to video games such as Legend of Zelda.

Each player controls a vase, who's goal is to grab their opponent and throw them against the walls and floors. When a vase breaks, they spew out a number of gems that can be picked up. 

## Controls

| Fast Fall  | S Key| K Key |

## Notes from Naton Cai
This was my first time using Godot and over all only my second time seriously developing in a game engine, so a lot of this was a learning experience. Thankfully Godot development was very intuitive for the most part. One of the things that was simply not possible given our timeframe was true online multiplayer. We knew from the very beginning that multiplayer was almost going to be impossible to implement so we settled on local same keyboard multiplayer. However, that did limit the options of controls for us. Had we had time to develop LAN or Online mutiplayer, I would have liked to have implmented the ability to aim with the mouse.
