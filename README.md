# Cracked
Cracked is a video game prototype built in Godot, designed by Naton Cai and John Pham. Cracked is a Smash style PVP game developed on the theme of smashing vases similar to video games such as Legend of Zelda.

Each player controls a vase, who's goal is to grab their opponent and throw them against the walls and floors. When a vase breaks, they spew out a number of gems that can be picked up. 

## Controls
| Control | P1 | P2 |
| --- | --- |---|
| Jump/Resist | W Key | I Key |
| Fast Fall  | S Key| K Key |
| Left | A Key | J Key |
| Right  | D Key | L Key|
| Grab/Throw | E Key  | U Key |


## Notes from Naton Cai
This was my first time using Godot and over all only my second time seriously developing in a game engine, so a lot of this was a learning experience. Thankfully Godot development was very intuitive for the most part. One of the things that was simply not possible given our timeframe was true online multiplayer. We knew from the very beginning that multiplayer was almost going to be impossible to implement so we settled on local same keyboard multiplayer. However, that did limit the options of controls for us. Had we had time to develop LAN or Online mutiplayer, I would have liked to have implmented the ability to aim with the mouse.

## Notes from John Pham
Learning Godot was honestly pretty fun for the most part when we were making the game. As for creating the art, I had a wonderful time brainstorming some of the characters as well as the custom UI and animation for some of the assets and Godot made it very easy to incorporate a lot of what was created. If we had more time to work on the project I would have liked to add more or fine tune a lot of the different animations for the player characters, such as a grab and hold animation as well as a throw animation. I would've also liked to add a background to the arena itself but given the limited time it wouldn't be possible.
